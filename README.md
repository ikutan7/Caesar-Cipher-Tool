First project that I feel like it's good enough to post to github. Haha

It's a Caesar Cipher Encoder and Decoder that's easy to use! It is Case Sensitive and also includes special characters (Such as @, #, $, etc.) and numbers.
It's made in Python and uses Tkinter for easier usage for the user.

Input your text, enter a shift value, select either Encode or Decode, and click run! It'll output what you're looking to encode/decode.
